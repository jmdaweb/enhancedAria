* Download [stable version][1]

This addon allows you to customize which aria landmarks are reported by NVDA when you browse the Internet.

Its functionality is very simple. Once installed, open your webbrowser and visit the web as usual. The default aria landmarks reported by Firefox and Chrome will also be visible in Internet Explorer, so you will be able to press quick navigation keys to jump between them, and list them by pressing NVDA+f7 in all browsers. Read the NVDA User Guide for more information.

The addon adds an extra landmark not included by default in NVDA, the article (abbreviated in Braille as art).

## The configuration dialog

You can enable or disable landmarks by going to NVDA, preferences, Enhanced Aria Settings or from the appropriate category in the NVDA options dialog. The dialog has a checkbox for each landmark. If you disable a landmark, you won't be able to jump to it pressing the d key when browsing a webpage, and NVDA won't report it.
